          # Regarding `--whole-files`, the linter is supposed to support linting of changed a patch only but,
          # for some reason, it's very unreliable this way - sometimes it does not report any or some
          # issues without linting the whole files, so we have to use `--whole-files`
          # which can lead to some frustration from developers who would like to

          # into fixing all linting issues in the whole file instead.
