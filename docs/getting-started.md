# Getting started

This page describes all steps required for going from zero to viewing a consolidated changelog.

## 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have `git` installed and available.

## 2. Install

Follow one of the installation ways described in [`./install.md`](./install.md).

### 2.1 Look at the tool concepts

The tool is based upon some [concepts](./concepts.md) that you may want to look at now.

## 3. Create a changelog fragment

From the root folder of the repository run:

```
$ elastic-agent-changelog-tool new "my test fragment"
```

This will create `./changelog/fragments/<timestamp>-my-test-fragment.yaml` with this content:

```yaml
# Kind can be one of:
# - breaking-change: a change to previously-documented behavior
# - deprecation: functionality that is being removed in a later release
# - bug-fix: fixes a problem in a previous version
# - enhancement: extends functionality but does not break or fix existing behavior
# - feature: new functionality
# - known-issue: problems that we are aware of in a given version
# - security: impacts on the security of a product or a userâ€™s deployment.
# - upgrade: important information for someone upgrading from a prior version
# - other: does not fit into any of the other categories
kind: feature

# Change summary; a 80ish characters long description of the change.
summary:

# Long description; in case the summary is not enough to describe the change
# this field accommodate a description without length limits.
#description:

# Affected component; a word indicating the component this changeset affects.
component:

# PR URL; optional; the PR number that added the changeset.
# If not present is automatically filled by the tooling finding the PR where this changelog fragment has been added.
# NOTE: the tooling supports backports, so it's able to fill the original PR number instead of the backport PR number.
# Please provide it if you are adding a fragment for a different PR.
#pr: https://github.com/owner/repo/1234

# Issue URL; optional; the GitHub issue related to this changeset (either closes or is part of).
# If not present is automatically filled by the tooling with the issue linked to the PR number.
#issue: https://github.com/owner/repo/1234
```

Ensure `kind` is correct and fill the `summary` field with a brief description.

Save and close the file.

## 4. Create the consolidated changelog

From the root folder of the repository run:

```
$ elastic-agent-changelog-tool build --version 0.1.0
```

This will create `./changelog/0.1.0.yaml` with content similar to this:

```yaml
version: 0.1.0
entries:
    - summary: Add Changelog Fragment creation
      description: ""
      kind: feature
      pr:
          - https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent-changelog-tool/pull/13
      issue: 
          - https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent-changelog-tool/issues/21
      timestamp: 1649924282
      file:
        name: 1649924282-changelog-fragment-creation.yaml
        checksum: 10bf1bf67509a524e48f0795be75c278e29c0b47

```

There will be multiple entries, one for each files in `changelog/fragments`.

## 5. Render the consolidated changelog

_Note_: at the moment there is only one renderer implemented: Asciidoc.

From the root folder of the repository run:

```
$ elastic-agent-changelog-tool render --version 0.1.0
```

This will create `./changelog/0.1.0.asciidoc`.
